# **HashiCorp Vault: **  

---

## **What is HashiCorp Vault?**  
HashiCorp Vault is a **secrets management tool** used to securely store, manage, and control access to sensitive information like **API keys, passwords, certificates, and encryption keys**. It ensures that secrets are encrypted at rest and in transit while providing **fine-grained access control**.

---

## **Why is HashiCorp Vault Needed?**  

### **Problem Without Vault**  
1. **Hardcoded Secrets** – Developers often store credentials in configuration files or code, making them vulnerable.  
2. **Lack of Access Control** – No way to restrict access to secrets per user or service.  
3. **Secret Rotation is Manual** – Updating secrets manually is error-prone.  
4. **No Secret Expiration** – Long-lived secrets increase the risk of misuse.  
5. **Secrets Sprawling** – Secrets may be spread across multiple places without proper tracking.

### **How Vault Solves the Problem**  
✅ Centralized and **encrypted** secrets storage  
✅ **Access control policies** for fine-grained permissions  
✅ **Dynamic secrets** – credentials are generated **on-demand** and automatically expire  
✅ **Secret rotation** to regularly update credentials  
✅ **Auditing and logging** to monitor secret access

## **HashiCorp Vault Architecture**  

### **1. Core Components**  
🔹 **Vault Server** – The main service that stores and manages secrets  
🔹 **Storage Backend** – Where secrets are stored (e.g., Consul, AWS S3, PostgreSQL)  
🔹 **Secrets Engines** – Plugins that manage different types of secrets (e.g., key-value, databases, cloud)  
🔹 **Authentication Methods** – How users and applications authenticate (e.g., token, GitHub, AWS IAM)  
🔹 **Policies** – Define access control rules for users/services  
🔹 **Audit Devices** – Log access and actions taken inside Vault  

### **2. How Vault Works**  
1️⃣ **Initialize Vault** → Generate keys & unseal  
2️⃣ **Authenticate** → Users/services authenticate with Vault  
3️⃣ **Authorize** → Policies define access permissions  
4️⃣ **Read/Write Secrets** → Store and retrieve secrets securely  
5️⃣ **Lease & Revoke** → Dynamic secrets are created & expire automatically

## **How to Use HashiCorp Vault? (Step-by-Step Guide)**  

### **Step 1: Install and Start Vault**
- Download & install Vault from [HashiCorp's official site](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/install).
- Start Vault in **development mode**:
  ```bash
  vault server -dev
  ```
- In production, use a **secure backend** like Consul or PostgreSQL.

---

### **Step 2: Initialize and Unseal Vault**
Before using Vault, it must be **initialized and unsealed**.

- **Initialize Vault:**
  ```bash
  vault operator init
  ```
  This generates:
  - **Unseal keys** (used to unseal Vault)
  - **Root token** (used to access Vault)

- **Unseal Vault (3 keys needed):**
  ```bash
  vault operator unseal <unseal-key-1>
  vault operator unseal <unseal-key-2>
  vault operator unseal <unseal-key-3>
  ```

- **Login using root token:**
  ```bash
  vault login <root-token>
  ```

---

### **Step 3: Enable a Secret Engine**  
Vault supports multiple **secret engines** (Key-Value, AWS, Database, etc.).

- Enable the **Key-Value (KV) secrets engine**:
  ```bash
  vault secrets enable -path=mysecrets kv
  ```
- Store a secret:
  ```bash
  vault kv put mysecrets/myapp password=supersecret
  ```
- Retrieve the secret:
  ```bash
  vault kv get mysecrets/myapp
  ```
  
🔹 **Use Case:** Securely storing API keys, passwords, or certificates.

---

### **Step 4: Implement Access Control with Policies**  
Vault uses **policies** to restrict access.

- **Create a read-only policy (`readonly.hcl`)**:
  ```hcl
  path "mysecrets/*" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
  }
  ```

- Apply the policy:
  ```bash
  vault policy write readonly readonly.hcl
  ```

- Assign policy to a user:
  ```bash
  vault token create -policy=readonly
  ```

🔹 **Use Case:** Developers can read secrets but not modify them.

---

### **Step 5: Enable Authentication Methods**  
Vault supports multiple authentication methods.

#### **AppRole Authentication (Best for Automation)**
1. Enable AppRole:
   ```bash
   vault auth enable approle
   ```
2. Create a role:
   ```bash
   vault write auth/approle/role/myapp policies="readonly"
   ```
3. Get the Role ID:
   ```bash
   vault read auth/approle/role/myapp/role-id
   ```
4. Get the Secret ID:
   ```bash
   vault write -force auth/approle/role/myapp/secret-id
   ```
5. Authenticate using Role ID and Secret ID:
   ```bash
   vault write auth/approle/login role_id="<ROLE_ID>" secret_id="<SECRET_ID>"
   ```

🔹 **Use Case:** Automating authentication for applications/services.

### **Step 6: Use Dynamic Secrets**  
Vault can generate **temporary credentials** for services.

#### **Example: Generate Dynamic MySQL Credentials**
1. Enable the database secrets engine:
   ```bash
   vault secrets enable database
   ```
2. Configure MySQL:
   ```bash
   vault write database/config/mydb \
       plugin_name=mysql-database-plugin \
       connection_url="mysql://root:password@localhost:3306/" \
       allowed_roles="readonly"
   ```
3. Define a role:
   ```bash
   vault write database/roles/readonly \
       db_name=mydb \
       creation_statements="CREATE USER '{{name}}'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '{{password}}';" \
       default_ttl="1h" \
       max_ttl="24h"
   ```
4. Generate a temporary MySQL user:
   ```bash
   vault read database/creds/readonly
   ```

🔹 **Use Case:** Applications get a new **temporary** database user instead of using a static password.

### **Step 7: Secret Leasing and Automatic Rotation**
- **Check Lease Expiry:**
  ```bash
  vault lease list database/creds/
  ```
- **Renew Lease:**
  ```bash
  vault lease renew database/creds/readonly
  ```
- **Revoke Secret Immediately:**
  ```bash
  vault lease revoke database/creds/readonly
  ```

🔹 **Use Case:** Prevent long-lived credentials from being misused.

---

### **Step 8: Enable Auditing**
Vault logs all secret access for security.

- **Enable File Audit Logging:**
  ```bash
  vault audit enable file file_path=/var/log/vault_audit.log
  ```
- **Check Audit Logs:**
  ```bash
  cat /var/log/vault_audit.log
  ```

🔹 **Use Case:** Monitor and track who accessed secrets.

## **Best Practices for HashiCorp Vault**
✅ **Use short-lived dynamic secrets** instead of static secrets.  
✅ **Restrict access** using Vault policies.  
✅ **Automate authentication** with AppRole or AWS IAM.  
✅ **Enable auditing** to monitor secret access.  
✅ **Use encryption-as-a-service** for sensitive data:
  ```bash
  vault write transit/encrypt/myapp plaintext=$(echo "mysecretdata" | base64)
  ```
✅ **Regularly rotate secrets** to prevent leaks.
