### **Scenario: Setting Up Multi-Environment Infrastructure**

Imagine you’re a DevOps engineer responsible for setting up infrastructure for a web application. You need to deploy the same infrastructure across **multiple environments** (e.g., `development`, `staging`, `production`) on AWS. Each environment has slight differences, such as instance sizes, region, or the number of instances.

Here’s how Terraform **variables** can make this task dynamic, reusable, and maintainable.

---

### **What Are Variables in This Scenario?**
- **Input Variables**: Allow you to parameterize configurations, so you don’t need to hardcode values like region, instance type, or count. This makes your configuration reusable across environments.
- **Output Variables**: Share key information (e.g., instance IDs, public IPs) with other teams or scripts after the infrastructure is created.

Without variables:
- You’d need separate Terraform files for each environment, leading to duplication and errors.
- Hardcoding values means every change (like switching regions) requires manually editing multiple files.

---

### **Why Are Variables Necessary?**
Variables solve the following challenges:
1. **Reusability**: One Terraform configuration can be used for multiple environments.
2. **Flexibility**: You can easily change values (like instance type or region) without editing the configuration files.
3. **Consistency**: All environments follow the same base configuration, reducing errors.
4. **Automation**: Dynamic input allows automation scripts (e.g., CI/CD pipelines) to supply values without modifying files.

### **How to Use Variables: Step-by-Step**

#### 1. **Defining Input Variables**
You want to configure the following parameters dynamically:
- AWS Region
- EC2 Instance Type
- Number of Instances

Define input variables in a `variables.tf` file:
```hcl
variable "aws_region" {
  description = "The AWS region to deploy resources in"
  type        = string
  default     = "us-east-1"  # Optional: Provide a default value
}

variable "instance_type" {
  description = "EC2 instance type"
  type        = string
  default     = "t2.micro"
}

variable "instance_count" {
  description = "Number of EC2 instances"
  type        = number
  default     = 1
}
```

---

#### 2. **Using Variables in Configuration**
Reference these variables in your `main.tf` file to create the infrastructure:
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0123456789abcdef0"  # Example AMI ID
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  count         = var.instance_count

  tags = {
    Name = "WebApp-${var.aws_region}"
  }
}
```

- The `var.<variable_name>` syntax injects the value of the input variable into the configuration.
- The `count` argument dynamically creates multiple instances based on `var.instance_count`.

---

#### 3. **Supplying Variable Values**
There are multiple ways to provide values for variables:

##### **a. Default Values**
If you provide a `default` value in the variable definition, Terraform uses it unless overridden.

##### **b. Command-Line Flags**
Override variables at runtime:
```bash
terraform apply -var="aws_region=us-west-2" -var="instance_count=3"
```

##### **c. Variable Files**
Create a `dev.tfvars` file for the development environment:
```hcl
aws_region    = "us-east-1"
instance_type = "t3.micro"
instance_count = 2
```
Then, use it with:
```bash
terraform apply -var-file="dev.tfvars"
```

---

#### 4. **Defining Output Variables**
After creating the infrastructure, you might want to expose values like:
- Instance IDs (to reference later).
- Public IP addresses (to SSH or update DNS).

Define output variables in `outputs.tf`:
```hcl
output "instance_ids" {
  description = "The IDs of the created EC2 instances"
  value       = aws_instance.example[*].id
}

output "public_ips" {
  description = "The public IPs of the created EC2 instances"
  value       = aws_instance.example[*].public_ip
}
```

- The `[*]` syntax iterates over multiple instances (if `count > 1`).

---

#### 5. **Accessing Outputs**
After running `terraform apply`, Terraform will display the output values:
```bash
Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

instance_ids = [
  "i-0abcd1234efgh5678",
  "i-0abcd1234efgh5679"
]
public_ips = [
  "54.123.45.67",
  "54.123.45.68"
]
```

---

### **End-to-End Workflow**

Let’s see how you’d manage environments with variables:

1. **Create a Variable File for Each Environment**  
   - `dev.tfvars` for development:
     ```hcl
     aws_region    = "us-east-1"
     instance_type = "t3.micro"
     instance_count = 1
     ```
   - `prod.tfvars` for production:
     ```hcl
     aws_region    = "us-west-2"
     instance_type = "m5.large"
     instance_count = 3
     ```

2. **Apply the Configuration**  
   Deploy infrastructure for a specific environment:
   ```bash
   terraform apply -var-file="dev.tfvars"
   ```

3. **Access Output Values**  
   Share instance information with your team:
   - Instance IDs for monitoring.
   - Public IPs for accessing the application.
