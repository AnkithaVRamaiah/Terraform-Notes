### 1. **What are Dynamic Blocks in Terraform?**

Dynamic blocks in Terraform allow you to programmatically generate nested blocks within a resource or module using loops. They are helpful for creating multiple similar configurations without hardcoding each block.

#### Syntax:
```hcl
dynamic "block_name" {
  for_each = var.items
  content {
    key   = block_name.value.key
    value = block_name.value.value
  }
}
```

#### Example:
Creating multiple security group rules:
```hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "example" {
  name = "example-sg"

  dynamic "ingress" {
    for_each = var.ingress_rules
    content {
      from_port   = ingress.value.from_port
      to_port     = ingress.value.to_port
      protocol    = ingress.value.protocol
      cidr_blocks = ingress.value.cidr_blocks
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. **How Do You Use `for` Expressions in Terraform?**

`for` expressions are used to transform or filter collections (lists, maps) in Terraform.

#### Syntax:
```hcl
[for item in list : transformed_item]
```

#### Example:
Transforming a list of strings into uppercase:
```hcl
variable "names" {
  default = ["alice", "bob", "charlie"]
}

output "uppercase_names" {
  value = [for name in var.names : upper(name)]
}
```

#### Filtering Example:
```hcl
output "filtered_names" {
  value = [for name in var.names : name if length(name) > 3]
}
```

---

### 3. **What Is the Purpose of the `count` Parameter?**

The `count` parameter is used to create multiple instances of a resource or module by defining the number of instances dynamically.

#### Example:
Creating multiple EC2 instances:
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  count         = 3
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "instance-${count.index + 1}"
  }
}
```
- `count.index`: Represents the current iteration index (0-based).

---

### 4. **Explain `depends_on` with Examples**

The `depends_on` meta-argument explicitly declares dependencies between resources to ensure proper execution order.

#### Example:
Ensuring a resource depends on another:
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "example-bucket"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "example" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17",
    Statement = [{
      Effect   = "Allow",
      Action   = "s3:*",
      Resource = "${aws_s3_bucket.example.arn}/*"
    }]
  })

  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket.example]
}
```
Even if the dependency isn't obvious, `depends_on` ensures Terraform creates the bucket before applying the policy.

### 5. **What Is a Provisioner in Terraform?**

Provisioners are used to execute scripts or commands on resources after they are created or destroyed. Common types include:
- **local-exec**: Executes commands on the Terraform host.
- **remote-exec**: Executes commands on the remote resource.

#### Example:
Using a provisioner to install Nginx on a remote server:
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt-get update",
      "sudo apt-get install -y nginx"
    ]
  }
}
```

### 6. **How Do You Use the `null_resource` Type in Terraform?**

The `null_resource` is a placeholder resource in Terraform. It is commonly used with provisioners, dynamic dependencies, or when you need an action without creating actual infrastructure.

#### Example:
Using `null_resource` for a script execution:
```hcl
resource "null_resource" "example" {
  triggers = {
    always_run = timestamp()
  }

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo 'This runs every apply!'"
  }
}
```
- The `triggers` argument ensures the resource is recreated whenever the condition changes.

---

### 7. **What Is the `local-exec` Provisioner, and When Is It Used?**

The `local-exec` provisioner runs commands on the machine where Terraform is executed. Itâ€™s typically used for integration tasks, such as triggering external scripts or notifying systems.

#### Example:
Notify a CI/CD pipeline:
```hcl
resource "null_resource" "example" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "curl -X POST -d 'Terraform applied' https://webhook.example.com/notify"
  }
}
```
- **When to Use**: For tasks like notifying external systems, executing local scripts, or debugging.

### 8. **How Does Terraform Handle Immutable Infrastructure Changes?**

Terraform adheres to the principle of **immutable infrastructure**, meaning it destroys and recreates resources when certain attributes change. This ensures consistency and avoids configuration drift.

#### Example:
Changing an AMI in an `aws_instance`:
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```
- Updating the AMI forces Terraform to destroy the old instance and recreate a new one.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Plan Phase**: Terraform shows what will be destroyed and created.
- **Lifecycle Rules**: You can use rules like `create_before_destroy` to minimize downtime.

### 9. **What Is a Terraform Override, and How Is It Used?**

Terraform overrides allow you to replace or customize configurations in a module or resource without modifying the original code. They are commonly used for local testing or debugging.

#### Example:
Override default values in a module:
```hcl
module "example" {
  source      = "./module"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

# Override in a local file
echo 'module "example" { instance_type = "t2.small" }' > override.tf
```

#### Best Practices:
- Avoid using overrides in production as they can cause confusion.
- Use variable inputs or explicit configurations instead of relying on overrides.
