### **6. Terraform Workspaces**

#### **1. What are Terraform workspaces?**
- Workspaces in Terraform are used to manage **multiple state files** within the same configuration directory.
- By default, Terraform operates in the **`default`** workspace.
- They allow managing infrastructure for different environments (e.g., dev, test, prod) without duplicating configuration code.
- **Example:**
  - Workspace names (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`) can be used to separate state files.

#### **2. How do workspaces differ from environments?**
- **Workspaces:**
  - Primarily about **state file management** within the same configuration directory.
  - Best suited for **small-scale setups** with slight differences between infrastructure instances.
  - Not meant for managing complex environments with significant differences.

- **Environments:**
  - Typically involve **separate configurations, directories, or repositories** for each environment.
  - Better suited for large-scale setups with unique configurations for dev, test, and prod.

#### **3. How do you create and switch between workspaces in Terraform?**
- **Create a new workspace:**
  ```bash
  terraform workspace new <workspace_name>
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  terraform workspace new dev
  ```

- **List available workspaces:**
  ```bash
  terraform workspace list
  ```

- **Switch to an existing workspace:**
  ```bash
  terraform workspace select <workspace_name>
  ```

- **Show the current workspace:**
  ```bash
  terraform workspace show
  ```

- Terraform keeps separate state files for each workspace, stored in the backend.

#### **4. What are the limitations of Terraform workspaces?**
- **Limited Scope:** Workspaces are just a mechanism for managing state; they donâ€™t offer full isolation of configurations.
- **Backend Limitations:** Some backends (e.g., local, S3) may not support advanced workspace features.
- **Complexity with Overrides:** Managing per-environment configurations (e.g., variable overrides) can become messy.
- **No Full Environment Separation:** For complex environments with different configurations, workspaces might not suffice.

---

#### **5. When should you not use workspaces?**
- **Complex Environments:** If environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod) require significantly different configurations, use separate directories or repositories.
- **Team Collaboration:** Workspaces can be confusing in multi-team setups due to shared state backends.
- **Cross-Environment Dependencies:** When environments depend on each other (e.g., networking or shared resources), managing them through workspaces can lead to unintended issues.
- **Advanced Configuration Needs:** If you need different providers, variables, or backends per environment, workspaces are not sufficient.

**Summary:**  
Terraform workspaces are ideal for simple use cases, such as isolating states for slightly different deployments. For complex or collaborative environments, it's better to use separate configurations or repositories to avoid the limitations of workspaces.
