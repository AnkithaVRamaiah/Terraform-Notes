### 1. Terraform vs CloudFormation: Compare Features

| **Feature**               | **Terraform**                                                                                                                                       | **CloudFormation**                                                                                     |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Platform**              | Multi-cloud and supports various providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, etc.).                                                                    | AWS-specific, designed for managing AWS resources.                                                   |
| **Language**              | Uses HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), which is simple and readable.                                                                         | Uses JSON or YAML for configuration, which may be verbose.                                           |
| **Portability**           | Highly portable across different cloud providers.                                                                                                 | Limited to AWS infrastructure.                                                                       |
| **State Management**      | Manages state in a `.tfstate` file, and supports remote backends like S3, Azure Blob, or Terraform Cloud.                                           | No explicit state file; AWS automatically manages infrastructure state.                              |
| **Modularity**            | Supports modules for reusable configurations.                                                                                                     | Provides nested stacks for reusability but is more AWS-centric.                                      |
| **Execution Plan**        | Shows a detailed execution plan (`terraform plan`) before applying changes.                                                                        | Does not explicitly show an execution plan; changes are applied directly.                            |
| **Third-party Providers** | Allows users to develop custom providers for unsupported services.                                                                                 | Limited to AWS and its predefined services.                                                          |
| **Community Support**     | Large community with extensive provider and module libraries on the Terraform Registry.                                                            | Supported by AWS, but less active in terms of third-party community contributions.                   |

### 2. Explain How to Handle State Lock Contention

Terraform locks the state file during operations to prevent concurrent modifications. If a lock is active, Terraform operations may fail with a lock contention error.

#### Steps to Resolve State Lock Contention:
1. **Identify the lock**: Check the error message for details on the lock owner and active operation.
2. **Force unlock**: Use the `terraform force-unlock` command to release the lock:
   ```bash
   terraform force-unlock <LOCK_ID>
   ```
3. **Avoid manual modifications**: Never modify the state file directly unless absolutely necessary.
4. **Remote backend setup**: Use remote state backends (e.g., S3 with DynamoDB for state locking) to handle locks properly.
5. **Plan execution**: Ensure only one person or automation system runs Terraform commands at a time.

### 3. Use Terraform to Deploy Kubernetes Resources

To deploy Kubernetes resources using Terraform:

1. **Provider Configuration**:
   ```hcl
   provider "kubernetes" {
     host                   = "<K8s_API_Server_Endpoint>"
     token                  = "<Authentication_Token>"
     client_certificate     = file("<path_to_cert>")
     client_key             = file("<path_to_key>")
     cluster_ca_certificate = file("<path_to_ca_cert>")
   }
   ```

2. **Define Resources**:
   Example: Deploy a pod in Kubernetes.
   ```hcl
   resource "kubernetes_pod" "example" {
     metadata {
       name = "nginx-pod"
     }
     spec {
       container {
         image = "nginx:latest"
         name  = "nginx"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Apply Changes**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

---

### 4. Difference Between `ignore_changes` and Lifecycle Rules

- **`ignore_changes`**: Prevents Terraform from detecting changes to specific attributes of a resource.
  ```hcl
  resource "aws_instance" "example" {
    ami           = "ami-12345678"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"

    lifecycle {
      ignore_changes = [instance_type]
    }
  }
  ```
  Use Case: Ignore manual changes to attributes like tags or scaling configurations.

- **Lifecycle Rules**: Controls how Terraform handles resource creation, deletion, and replacement using:
  - `create_before_destroy`: Ensures replacement resources are created before destroying old ones.
  - `prevent_destroy`: Prevents accidental deletion of critical resources.

  ```hcl
  resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
    bucket = "my-bucket"

    lifecycle {
      prevent_destroy = true
    }
  }
  ```

---

### 5. Deploy a Custom Terraform Provider

1. **Develop the Provider**:
   - Write a Go-based plugin for your custom service using the Terraform Plugin SDK.
   - Define schemas, resource CRUD functions, and data sources.

2. **Build the Provider**:
   - Compile the plugin into a binary using `go build`.

3. **Install the Provider**:
   - Place the provider binary in the `~/.terraform.d/plugins/` directory.

4. **Configure in Terraform**:
   ```hcl
   terraform {
     required_providers {
       custom = {
         source = "example.com/custom/provider"
         version = "1.0.0"
       }
     }
   }

   provider "custom" {
     endpoint = "https://api.example.com"
   }
   ```

5. **Use the Provider**:
   Define resources and apply the configuration.

### 6. Handle Multi-cloud Deployments

#### Steps for Multi-cloud Deployments:
1. Configure providers for each cloud:
   ```hcl
   provider "aws" {
     region = "us-east-1"
   }

   provider "azurerm" {
     features {}
   }
   ```

2. Define resources for each cloud:
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
     bucket = "my-aws-bucket"
   }

   resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
     name     = "my-azure-resource-group"
     location = "East US"
   }
   ```

3. Manage dependencies and outputs to share information across clouds.

### 7. Integrate Terraform with Jenkins/GitHub Actions

- **Jenkins**:
  1. Install the Terraform plugin for Jenkins.
  2. Configure a Jenkins pipeline with Terraform commands (`init`, `plan`, `apply`).
  3. Pass variables and credentials via Jenkins environment variables or secrets.

- **GitHub Actions**:
  Use the `hashicorp/setup-terraform` action:
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    terraform:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Checkout Code
          uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - name: Set up Terraform
          uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2
        - name: Terraform Init
          run: terraform init
        - name: Terraform Plan
          run: terraform plan
        - name: Terraform Apply
          run: terraform apply -auto-approve
  ```

---

### 8. Write a Custom Dynamic Block for a Reusable Resource Group

Example: Create a dynamic block for multiple subnets.
```hcl
resource "aws_vpc" "example" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

resource "aws_subnet" "example" {
  count = length(var.subnet_cidrs)

  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.example.id
  cidr_block = element(var.subnet_cidrs, count.index)
}
```

---

### 9. Compare `terraform fmt` and `terraform validate`

- **`terraform fmt`**:
  - Automatically formats `.tf` files to align with Terraform's coding style.
  - Does not check for syntax or configuration errors.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    terraform fmt
    ```

- **`terraform validate`**:
  - Checks `.tf` files for syntax and logical errors.
  - Ensures the configuration is valid and ready for execution.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    terraform validate
    ```

---

### 10. Explain the Difference Between `remote-exec` and `local-exec`

- **`remote-exec`**:
  - Runs commands on the remote machine where the resource is created.
  - Example:
    ```hcl
    provisioner "remote-exec" {
      inline = ["sudo apt-get update", "sudo apt-get install -y nginx"]
    }
    ```

- **`local-exec`**:
  - Runs commands on the machine where Terraform is executed.
  - Example:
    ```hcl
    provisioner "local-exec" {
      command = "echo 'Deployment complete'"
    }
    ```
