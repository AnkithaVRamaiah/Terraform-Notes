# **2. Intermediate Terraform Skills**
#### a. **Variables and Outputs**  
   - Use input variables for flexibility (`variables.tf`).  
   - Define outputs to expose data from your configurations (`outputs.tf`).  

#### b. **State Management**  
   - Learn how Terraform state works and why it's essential.  
   - Understand the difference between local and remote state storage.  
   - Set up a remote backend (e.g., S3 for AWS).  
   - Commands to manage state:
     ```bash
     terraform state list
     terraform state show
     terraform state mv
     terraform state rm
     ```

#### c. **Modules**  
   - Learn to structure your code with reusable modules.  
   - Create custom modules for common infrastructure components.  
   - Use public modules from the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/).

#### d. **Provisioners**  
   - Use provisioners (e.g., `file`, `remote-exec`, `local-exec`) to execute scripts during resource creation.
